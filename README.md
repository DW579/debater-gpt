# Debater-GPT

Debater-GPT is a web application that engages you in a debate using OpenAIâ€™s Chat-GPT 3 technology. The idea for this application was inspired by IBM Watson's Project Debater. With this application, you can choose to watch a debate between OpenAI's Chat-GPT 3, or you can participate in a debate against Chat-GPT 3 or another user. Chat-GPT 3 will analyze each argument and provide feedback on the debate techniques used. To view the feedback, simply click on the argument.
